# Shallow Learning Basics:

This lecture introduces fundamental concepts of **shallow learning** through practical implementations of:

- Perceptron
- Adaline (using batch gradient descent)
- Adaline (using stochastic gradient descent)

These models serve as the foundation for understanding modern machine learning approaches by illustrating how linear classifiers learn from data using simple yet powerful optimization techniques.
