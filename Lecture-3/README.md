# Deep Learning Fundamentals: From Scratch to PyTorch

In this lecture, we will break down the core steps behind any deep learning algorithm and build intuition through hands-on coding.

## What You'll Learn

We will explain the typical model training loop as shown below:

Using a simple **linear regression** task, we'll explore:

- How models learn
- What role parameters like **learning rate** and **batch size** play
- What **gradient descent** is
- How **optimization** updates model weights

## How to Install PyTorch

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.
Go to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) webpage, and follow the instructions  

Example for **Windows + Pip + CUDA 11.8**:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
